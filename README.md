# Gmail Spam Detection System 📧🤖

This project implements a **Machine Learning based Spam Detection System** for Gmail.  
It classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **NLP, feature extraction, and ML models**.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean email text  
- Apply feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag of Words)  
- Train ML models for classification  
- Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- NLTK / SpaCy (NLP)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook
